<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About me</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in [Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](https://www.chbe.illinois.edu) at [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Diwakar Shukla](https://shuklagroup.org). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's Degree from  [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm). 

My research lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Computational Chemistry**, using Machine Learning (ML) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations to investigate complex chemical and biological processes, including peptide drug discovery, peptide-protein interactions, <em>de novo</em> protein, peptide, and ligand design.
